# Proposed method installation and usage instructions (Python)
Here, we include a Python version of the proposal with modifications. To run this code, see file [*main_python.py*](https://github.com/robert-abc/KTC2023-ABC1/blob/main/KTC2023_Python_A01%2B/main_python.py) using the same structure of three input arguments explained in the Matlab code. An example of how to run this version in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is available in the jupyter notebook [*example_python_reconstruction.ipynb*](https://github.com/robert-abc/KTC2023-ABC1/blob/main/KTC2023_Python_A01%2B/example_python_reconstruction.ipynb).

As an improvement to the proposal, we used the [Optuna framework](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to implement an automatic hyperparameter optimization to find the best values for some of the hyperparameters used in the proposal. The code to execute the optimization is available in the file [*hyperparameter_optimization.py*](https://github.com/robert-abc/KTC2023-ABC1/blob/main/KTC2023_Python_A01%2B/hyperparameter_optimization.py), and an example of executing it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is available at the jupyter notebook [*example_hyperparameter_optimization.ipynb*](https://github.com/robert-abc/KTC2023-ABC1/blob/main/KTC2023_Python_A01%2B/example_hyperparameter_optimization.ipynb).
